## Introduction
This library provides a highly customizable **Tab Bar** for iOS, designed to give your application a modern and sleek aesthetic. The standout feature is the **cutout indicator**, which creates a fluid, "floating" visual effect that follows the active tab.

Built entirely in **Swift**, it is lightweight, easy to integrate, and supports both static and animated transitions. Whether you are aiming for a minimalist design or a bold UI, this component provides the flexibility to adjust colors, corner radii, and indicator shapes to fit your brand.
